# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file starting from version 0.1.3.

Please note that this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). As carter-py is built around an API which is still in beta, breaking changes may be introduced indirectly in minor releases. Major releases will be reserved for breaking changes to the way in carter-py is used. IE. function names, parameter depreciations etc. Where a breaking change is made on the API side, carter-py will be updated to reflect this change.

I will continue to build carter-py with the intention of maintaining backwards compatibility, but this is not guaranteed. Previous versions of carter-py are always likely to be outdated as the API progresses. Please consult the changelog for any breaking changes and try to use the latest version of carter-py.
